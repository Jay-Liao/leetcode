# 237. Delete Node in a Linked List (Easy/AC47)
---
Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
Supposed the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and you are given the third node with value 3, the linked list should become 1 -> 2 -> 4 after calling your function.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def deleteNode(self, node):
        """
        :type node: ListNode
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify node in-place instead.
        """
        node.val=node.next.val
        node.next=node.next.next
```
# 206. Reverse Linked List (Easy/AC46)
---
Hint:
A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def reverseList(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        prev = None
        current = head
        while current:
            next_node = current.next
            current.next = prev
            prev = current
            current = next_node
        return prev
```
